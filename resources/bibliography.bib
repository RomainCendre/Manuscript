abstract = {A number of noninvasive approaches have been developed over the years to provide objective evaluation of the skin both in health and in disease. The advent of computers, as well as of lasers and photonics, has made it possible to develop additional techniques that were impossible a few years ago. These approaches provide the dermatologist with sensitive tools to measure the skin's condition in terms of physiologic parameters (e.g., color, erythema and pigmentation, induration, sebaceous and stratum corneum lipids, barrier function, etc.). Yet, a typical dermatologic diagnosis relies primarily on the trained eyes of the physician and to a lesser extent on information from other senses, such as touch and smell. The trained senses of the dermatologist backed by his/her brain form a powerful set of tools for evaluating the skin. The golden rule in diagnosis remains the histologic examination of a skin biopsy, a rather invasive method. These tools have served the profession well. The advent of ever faster and cheaper computers and of sensitive, inexpensive optical instrumentation of minimal dimensions provides the professional with the possibility of making objective measures of a number of skin parameters.},

In a 70-kg individual, the skin weighs over 5 kg and covers a surface area approaching 2 m 2 . Human skin consists of a stratifi ed, cellular epidermis and an underlying dermis of connective tissue (Fig. 3.1). Beneath the dermis is a layer of subcutaneous fat, which is separated from the rest of the body by a vestigial layer of striated muscle. The epidermis is mainly composed of keratinocytes and is typi-cally 0.05–0.1 mm in thickness. It is formed by division of cells in the basal layer which give rise to the spinous layer. This layer contains cells that move outwards and progressively differentiate, forming the granular layer and the stratum corneum. The cellular progression from the basal layer to the skin surface takes about 30 days but is accelerated in diseases such as psoriasis. The 'brick-like' shape of keratinocytes is provided by a cytoskeleton made of keratin intermediate fi laments. As the epidermis differentiates, the keratinocytes become fl attened. This process involves the fi lament aggregating protein, fi laggrin, a protein component of keratohya-lin granules. Indeed, keratin and fi laggrin comprise 80–90{\%} of the mass of the epidermis. The outermost layer of the epidermis is the stratum corneum, where cells (now called corneocytes) have lost nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles. The corneocyte has a highly insoluble, cornifi ed envelope within the plasma membrane, formed by cross-linking of soluble protein precursors, including involucrin and loricrin, the latter contributing 70–85{\%} to the mass of the cornifi ed cell envelope; it also contains several lipids (fatty acids, sterols and ceramides) released from lamellar bodies within the upper, living epidermis. Other cells in the epidermis are the melanocytes, Langerhans' cells and Merkel cells. Melanocytes are dendritic cells that distribute packages of melanin pigment in melanosomes to surrounding keratinocytes to give skin its colour. The number of melanocytes does not differ much between white and black skin. Rather it is the nature of the melanin and the size of the melanosomes that account for the different appearances. The Langerhans' cells are also dendritic in nature, although these are of mesenchymal origin and originate from bone marrow. Langerhans' cells are antigen-presenting cells and process anti-gens encountered by the skin to local lymph nodes and thus have a key role in adaptive immune responses in the skin. Merkel cells are probably derived from keratinocytes. They have a role as mechanosensory receptors in response to touch. Human skin contains pilosebaceous follicles and sweat glands. The hair follicles comprise pockets of epithelium that are continu-ous with the superfi cial epidermis but which also envelop a small papilla of dermis at their base. A bundle of smooth muscle, the arrector pili, extends at an angle between the surface of the dermis and a point in the follicle wall. Above the insertion, there are holocrine sebaceous glands which open into the pilary canal. In some sites, such as the axillae, the follicles may be associated with apocrine glands. Also derived from the epidermis and opening directly to the skin surface are the eccrine sweat glands. The epidermis is attached to the dermis via a complex network of proteins and glycoproteins that extend from inside basal},

abstract = {Lentigo maligna melanoma is an increasingly common melanoma subtype worldwide, occurring mainly on the head and neck of older, light-skinned individuals. This subtype poses specific challenges in diagnosis and management, including histologic differentiation from surrounding sun-damaged skin with atypical melanocytes, optimizing treatment in anatomically constrained sites where this melanoma subtype tends to occur, and reducing local recurrence rates related to subclinical extensions, all while taking into account quality of life issues and suitability of surgical, topical, and/or radiation therapy in an elderly population. Noninvasive tools such as dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy can facilitate early diagnosis. Treatment options include surgical and nonsurgical modalities which are complicated by frequent subclinical extension of the tumor and more complex anatomic location. Surgical options include conventional wide excision and techniques that provide exhaustive peripheral margin control, including staged excision with permanent sections and Mohs micrographic surgery, both of which may reduce rates of local recurrence. Nonsurgical therapies include off-label topical imiquimod and radiation therapy, which are generally second-line but may be preferable in certain instances based on patient comorbidities and/or limited life expectancy, quality of life issues, and/or preference for nonsurgical treatment. Recurrence may occur years after initial treatment, necessitating the need for long-term follow-up.},

abstract = {Abstract   This paper is about generalized Fourier descriptors, and their application to the research of invariants under group actions. A general methodology is developed, crucially related to Pontryagin's, Tannaka's, Chu's and Tatsuuma's dualities, from abstract harmonic analysis. Application to motion groups provides a general methodology for pattern recognition. This methodology generalizes the classical basic method of Fourier-invariants of contours of objects. In the paper, we use the results of this theory, inside a Support-Vector-Machine context, for 3D objects-recognition. As usual in practice, we classify 3D objects starting from 2D information. However our method is rather general and could be applied directly to 3D data, in other contexts. Our applications and comparisons with other methods are about human-face recognition, but also we provide tests and comparisons based upon standard data-bases such as the COIL data-base. Our methodology looks extremely efficient, and effective computations are rather simple and low cost. The paper is divided in two parts: first, the part relative to applications and computations, in a SVM environment. The second part is devoted to the development of the general theory of generalized Fourier-descriptors, with several new results, about their completeness in particular. These results lead to simple formulas for motion-invariants of images, that are {\^{a}} complete{\^{a}} in a certain sense, and that are used in the first part of the paper. The computation of these invariants requires only standard FFT estimations, and one dimensional integration.},

abstract = {Background: The identification of "normal" dermoscopic patterns of acquired melanocytic nevi provides better diagnostic accuracy for melanoma in people with black skin. Objective: We sought to describe melanocytic lesions (numbers and anatomic distributions) in skin types V and VI compared with skin types I and II, according to the Fitzpatrick classification. We sought to identify differences in dermoscopic findings in acquired melanocytic nevi (global pattern, pigment and color distribution) between the groups. Methods: We conducted cross-sectional, prospective, and consecutive data collection in 2 dermatologic outpatient clinics, between October 8, 2010, and March 20, 2013. From the 501 volunteers, 480 participants fulfilled the eligibility criteria. A total of 460 acquired melanocytic nevi were selected for dermoscopic analysis. Results: Individuals with skin type V/VI had fewer melanocytic lesions than those with skin type I/II (15.08 vs 7.90; P = .032), and the anatomic distribution in the first group was predominantly on the face and acral sites (P {\textless} .001). The acquired melanocytic nevi in the skin type V/VI group were associated with the reticular pattern (P {\textless} .0001), with a tendency toward central hyperpigmentation (P = .0025). Limitations: The choice of a single representative nevus per patient is a limitation. Conclusions: Acquired melanocytic nevi in individuals with skin type V/VI have a distinct dermoscopic pattern from those with skin type I/II.},

These two procedures are in some cases solving equivalent problems, but with quite different algorithms. In this article we bring the two approaches together, leading to an efficient algorithm for large matrix factorization and completion that outperforms both of these.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite recent improvements in prevention, diagnosis and treatment, vast differences in melanoma burden still exist between populations. Comparative data can highlight these differences and lead to focused efforts to reduce the burden of melanoma. OBJECTIVES To assess global, regional and national melanoma incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015. METHODS Vital registration system and cancer registry data were used for melanoma mortality modelling. Incidence and prevalence were estimated using separately modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios. Total prevalence was divided into four disease phases and multiplied by disability weights to generate years lived with disability (YLDs). Deaths in each age group were multiplied by the reference life expectancy to generate years of life lost (YLLs). YLDs and YLLs were added to estimate DALYs. RESULTS The five world regions with the greatest melanoma incidence, DALY and mortality rates were Australasia, North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Central Europe. With the exception of regions in sub-Saharan Africa, DALY and mortality rates were greater in men than in women. DALY rate by age was highest in those aged 75-79 years, 70-74 years and ≥ 80 years. CONCLUSIONS The greatest burden from melanoma falls on Australasian, North American, European, elderly and male populations, which is consistent with previous investigations. These substantial disparities in melanoma burden worldwide highlight the need for aggressive prevention efforts. The Global Burden of Disease Study results can help shape melanoma research and public policy.},

In vivo tumor model was made by inoculating human glioma cell line U87-MG subcutaneously in nude mice. The tumor was sonicated by 25-kHz ultrasound 4 hours following administration of 5-ALA. The tumor size decreased in 5-ALA administered (ALA(+)US(+)) mice, while increased in non-5-ALA administrated (ALA(-)US(+)) mice and non-sonicated mice (ALA(+)US(-)). The immunohistochemical analysis revealed an apoptotic change in tumor tissue of ALA(+)US(+) mice. The results showed the therapeutic effect of 25 kHz ultrasound for the glioma in 5-ALA administered tumor-bearing mice by inducing apoptotic change of tumor cells. This is a first report to elucidate the feasibility of therapeutic use of 25 kHz, relatively low frequency, ultrasound in sonodynamic therapy using 5-ALA as a sonosensitizer precursor. The utilization of this frequency will contribute to the development of sonodynamic therapy for gliomas and the spread of this technique in many hospitals that possess ultrasonic aspirators.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in fair-skinned populations in many parts of the world. The incidence, morbidity and mortality rates of skin cancers are increasing and, therefore, pose a significant public health concern. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the major etiologic agent in the development of skin cancers. UVR causes DNA damage and genetic mutations, which subsequently lead to skin cancer. A clearer understanding of UVR is crucial in the prevention of skin cancer. This article reviews UVR, its damaging effects on the skin and its relationship to UV immunosuppression and skin cancer. Several factors influence the amount of UVR reaching the earth's surface, including ozone depletion, UV light elevation, latitude, altitude, and weather conditions. The current treatment modalities utilizing UVR (i.e. phototherapy) can also predispose to skin cancers. Unnecessary exposure to the sun and artificial UVR (tanning lamps) are important personal attributable risks. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of skin cancer with an emphasis on carefully evaluated statistics, the epidemiology of UVR-induced skin cancers, incidence rates, risk factors, and preventative behaviors {\&} strategies, including personal behavioral modifications and public educational initiatives.},

abstract = {This paper describes the histogenesis of 3 forms of human malignant melanoma: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, and lentigo maligna melanoma. A comparative analysis by computer of the biologic behavior and clinical characteristics of the different neoplasms has been done. An additional 60 tumors have been studied by serial block section ing. Evidence is presented suggesting that superficial spreading melanoma and lentigo maligna melanoma (Hutchinson's mela notic freckle), though evolving at different rates, show a long period of superficial growth, followed by the relatively rapid appearance of nodules or deeper invasion within the primary lesion. This change in the nature of the primary lesion may be due to the appearance of one or more strains of cells of aggres sive biologic potential. Thus the primary melanoma may exist for a relatively long period of time during which host selec tional forces act to permit the growth of quite malignant strains of cells. It is these cells that seem to be capable of deeper growth. The subdivision of each of the forms of mela noma into 5 anatomic levels of invasion permits the accurate assignment of prognosis to each case. It is suggested that mela nomas are tumors of the epidermal melanocytes and are not necessarily derived from melanocytic nevi. Each melanoma has a distinctive clinical appearance, even in its superficial and curable phases, and this appearance is the same whether or not the process arose in association with a melanocytic nevus.},

Biopsies from three different body sites of 71 human volunteers were obtained, and thickness of the stratum corneum and cellular epidermis was measured microscopically using a preparation technique preventing tissue damage. Multiple regressions analysis was used to evaluate the effect of the various factors independently of each other. Mean (SD) thickness of the stratum corneum was 18.3 (4.9) mmat the dorsal aspect of the forearm, 11.0 (2.2) mm at the shoulder and 14.9 (3.4) mm at the buttock. Corresponding values for the cellular epidermis were 56.6 (11.5) mm, 70.3 (13.6) mm and 81.5 (15.7) mm, respectively. Body site largely explains the variation in epidermal thickness, but also a significant individual variation was observed. Thickness of the stratum corneum correlated positively to pigmentation ( p{\~{}}0.0008) and negatively to the number of years of smoking ( pv0.0001).

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is used for quick medical checkups. The aim of this study is to check the discrimination power of texture features for the automatic identification of diagnostic significant regions in CLSM views of skin lesions. METHODS: In tissue counter analysis (TCA) the images are dissected in equal square elements, where different classes of features are calculated out. Features defined in the spatial domain are based on histogram (grey level distribution) and co-occurrence matrix (grey level combinations). The features defined in the frequency domain are based on spectral properties of the wavelet Daubechie 4 transform (texture exploration at different scales) and the Fourier transform (global texture properties are localized in the spectrum). Hundred cases of benign common nevi and malignant melanoma were used as the study set. Classification was done with CART (Classification and Regression Trees) analysis which splits the set of square elements into homogenous terminal nodes and generates a set of splitting rules. RESULTS: Features based on the wavelet transform provide the best results with 96.0{\%} of correctly classified elements from benign common nevi and 97.0{\%} from malignant melanoma. The classification results are relocated to the images by use of the splitting rules as diagnostic aid. The discriminated square elements are highlighted in the images, showing tissue with features in good accordance with typical diagnostic CLSM features. CONCLUSION: Square elements with more than 80{\%} of discrimination power enable the identification of diagnostic highly significant parts in confocal microscopic views of malignant melanoma.},

However, no study compared the diagnostic accuracy of these techniques. Objective: We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM for LM/LMM using a holistic assessment of the images. Methods: A total of 223 facial lesions were evaluated by 21 experts. Diagnostic accuracy of the clinical, dermoscopic and RCM examination was compared. Interinvestigator variability and confidence level in the diagnosis were also evaluated. Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy of the two imaging techniques was good (area under the curve of the sROC function: 0.89). RCM was more sensitive (80{\%}, vs. 61{\%}) and less specific (81{\%} vs. 92{\%}) than dermoscopy for LM/LMM. In particular, RCM showed a higher sensitivity for hypomelanotic and recurrent LM/LMM. RCM had a higher interinvestigator agreement and a higher confidence level in the diagnosis than dermoscopy. Conclusion: Reflectance confocal microscopy and dermoscopy are both useful techniques for the diagnosis of facial lesions and in particular LM/LMM. RCM is particularly suitable for the identification of hypomelanotic and recurrent LM/LMM.},

abstract = {This work presents a generic computer vision system designed for exploiting trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a generic feature extractor and mixing these features with more traditional hand-crafted features. Such a system is a single structure that can be used for synthesizing a large number of different image classification tasks. Three substructures are proposed for creating the generic computer vision system starting from handcrafted and non-handcrafter features: i) one that remaps the output layer of a trained CNN to classify a different problem using an SVM; ii) a second for exploiting the output of the penultimate layer of a trained CNN as a feature vector to feed an SVM; and iii) a third for merging the output of some deep layers, applying a dimensionality reduction method, and using these features as the input to an SVM. The application of feature transform techniques to reduce the dimensionality of feature sets coming from the deep layers represents one of the main contributions of this paper. Three approaches are used for the non-handcrafted features: deep transfer learning features based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), principal component analysis network (PCAN), and the compact binary descriptor (CBD). For the handcrafted features, a wide variety of state-of-the-art algorithms are considered: Local Ternary Patterns, Local Phase Quantization, Rotation Invariant Co-occurrence Local Binary Patterns, Completed Local Binary Patterns, Rotated local binary pattern image, Globally Rotation Invariant Multi-scale Co-occurrence Local Binary Pattern, and several others. The computer vision system based on the proposed approach was tested on many different datasets, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed approach thanks to the strong performance recorded. The Wilcoxon signed rank test is used to compare the different methods; moreover, the independence of the different methods is studied using the Q-statistic. To facilitate replication of our experiments, the MATLAB source code will be available at (https://www.dropbox.com/s/bguw035yrqz0pwp/ElencoCode.docx?dl=0).},

@article{Dasarathy1997,
abstract = {Sensor fusion models have been characterized in the literature in a number of distinctly different ways: in terms of information levels at which the fusion is accomplished; the objectives of the fusion process, the application domain; the types of sensors employed, the sensor suite configuration and so on. The characterization most commonly encountered in the rapidly growing sensor fusion literature based on level of detail in the information is that of the now well known triplet: data level, feature level, and decision level. We consider here a generalized input-output (I/O) descriptor pair based characterization of the sensor fusion process that can be looked upon as a natural out growth of the trilevel characterization. The fusion system design philosophy expounded here is that an exhaustive exploitation of the sensor fusion potential should explore fusion under all of the different I/O-based fusion modes conceivable under such a characterization. Fusion system architectures designed to permit such exploitation offer the requisite flexibility for developing the most effective fusion system designs for a given application. A second facet of this exploitation is aimed at exploring the new concept of self-improving multisensor fusion system architectures wherein the central (fusion system) and focal (individual sensor subsystems) decision makers mutually enhance the other's performance by providing reinforced learning. A third facet is that of investigating fusion system architectures for environments wherein the different local decision makers may only be capable of narrower decisions that span only a subset of decision choices. The paper discusses these flexible fusion system architectures along with related issues and illustrates them with examples of their application to real-world scenarios.},

abstract = {MOST verbal communication occurs in contexts where the listener can see the speaker as well as hear him. However, speech perception is normally regarded as a purely auditory process. The study reported here demonstrates a previously unrecognised influence of vision upon speech perception. It stems from an observation that, on being shown a film of a young woman's talking head, in which repeated utterances of the syllable [ba] had been dubbed on to lip movements for [ga], normal adults reported hearing [da]. With the reverse dubbing process, a majority reported hearing [bagba] or [gaba]. When these subjects listened to the soundtrack from the film, without visual input, or when they watched untreated film, they reported the syllables accurately as repetitions of [ba] or [ga]. Subsequent replications confirm the reliability of these findings; they have important implications for the understanding of speech perception. {\textcopyright} 1976 Nature Publishing Group.},

Diagnosis is complicated, however, as it shares clinical and dermoscopic characteristics with other cutaneous lesions of the face. Reflectance confocal microscopy is an imaging technique that permits the visualization of characteristic features of lentigo maligna. These include a disrupted honeycomb pattern and pagetoid cells with a tendency to show folliculotropism. These cells typically have a dendritic morphology, although they may also appear as round cells measuring over 20$\mu$m with atypical nuclei. Poorly defined dermal papillae and atypical cells may be seen at the dermal-epidermal junction and can form bridges resembling mitochondrial structures. Other characteristic findings include junctional swelling with atypical cells located around the follicles, resembling caput medusae. Reflectance confocal microscopy is a very useful tool for diagnosing lentigo maligna. ER},

A total of 64 RCM features were scored retrospectively and blinded to diagnosis in a consecutive series of RCM sampled, clinically equivocal, macules of the face (n=81 LM, n=203 benign macules (BMs)). In addition to describing RCM diagnostic features for LM (univariate), an algorithm was developed (LM score) to distinguish LM from BM. This comprised two major features each scoring +2 points (nonedged papillae and round large pagetoid cells >20μm), and four minor features; three scored +1 point each (three or more atypical cells at the dermoepidermal junction in five 0.5 × 0.5mm2 fields, follicular localization of atypical cells, and nucleated cells within the dermal papillae), and one (negative) feature scored -1 point (a broadened honeycomb pattern). A LM score of ≥2 resulted in a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 76% for the diagnosis of LM (odds ratio (OR) for LM 18.6; 95% confidence interval: 9.3–37.1). The algorithm was equally effective in the diagnosis of amelanotic lesions and showed good interobserver reproducibility (87%). In a test set of 29 LMs and 44 BMs, the OR for LM was 60.7 (confidence interval: 11.9–309) (93% sensitivity, 82% specificity)."

To have deeper insight in to the role of neighbourhood properties and the filter banks in the texture description, extensive experimentation is performed over the image sets containing noisy and rotated variants of the textures from Brodatz album. A method for estimating rotation variance (RV) of a texture descriptor is also presented, which gives an idea of how rotation-sensitive is a certain texture descriptor. The results establish that the DFT-based features outperform the features based on Gabor filters in noiseless conditions whereas the later outperform otherwise. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

We introduce here a new database called {\&}{\#}x201C;ImageNet{\&}{\#}x201D;, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2{\%} top-1 and 5.6{\%} top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters.

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question: Are there any benefits to combining Inception architectures with residual connections? Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and nonresidual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4 networks, we achieve 3.08{\%} top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge.},

In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of important metrics in practical applications: accuracy, memory footprint, parameters, operations count, inference time and power consumption. Key findings are: (1) power consumption is independent of batch size and architecture; (2) accuracy and inference time are in a hyperbolic relationship; (3) energy constraint is an upper bound on the maximum achievable accuracy and model complexity; (4) the number of operations is a reliable estimate of the inference time.

abstract = {With the continuous expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems, such as surveillance, security, Internet, and finance, it becomes critical to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge discovery and analysis from raw data to support decision-making processes. Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

However, imbalanced distributions exist pervasively between faulty and normal samples, which leads to imprecise fault diagnostics and prognostics. In this paper, an effective imbalance learning algorithm Easy-SMT is proposed. Easy-SMT is an integrated ensemble-based method, which comprises synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)-based oversampling policy to augment minority faulty classes and EasyEnsemble to transfer an imbalanced class learning problem into an ensemble-based balanced learning subproblem. We validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in a real wind turbine failure forecast challenge, and our solution has won the third place among hundreds of teams. Moreover, we also evaluate the method on prognostics and health management 2015 challenge datasets, and the results show that the model could also achieve good performance on multiclass imbalance learning task compared with baseline classifiers.},

Weight of a class is usually determined by proportion of samples in each class in training set. This paper analyzes that sample proportions of training set and testing set may vary in some range and it would compromise performance of learned classifier. This problem becomes serious when class distribution is extremely high imbalanced. Based on the analysis, an adaptive weighting approach aiming at finding a group of proper weights for classes is proposed. We employ evolutionary algorithm to optimize weight configuration to ensure overall performance of classifier in both training set and possible testing sets.

It is a generalization of the standard tree induction process where only the initial instance weights determine the type of tree to be induced-minimum error trees or minimum high cost error trees. We demonstrate that it can be easily adapted to an existing tree learning algorithm. Previous research provides insufficient evidence to support the idea that the greedy divide-and-conquer algorithm can effectively induce a truly cost-sensitive tree directly from the training data. We provide this empirical evidence in this paper. The algorithm incorporating the instance-weighting method is found to be better than the original algorithm in in of total misclassification costs, the number of high cost errors, and tree size two-class data sets. The instance-weighting method is simpler and more effective in implementation than a previous method based on altered priors.},

When learning from highly imbalanced data, most classifiers are overwhelmed by the majority class examples, so the false negative rate is always high. Although researchers have introduced many methods to deal with this problem, including resampling techniques and cost-sensitive learning (CSL), most of them focus on either of these techniques. This study presents two empirical methods that deal with class imbalance using both resampling and CSL. The first method combines and compares several sampling techniques with CSL using support vector machines (SVM). The second method proposes using CSL by optimizing the cost ratio (cost matrix) locally. Our experimental results on 18 imbalanced datasets from the UCI repository show that the first method can reduce the misclassification costs, and the second method can improve the classifier performance.},

Low level feature extraction involves automatic extraction of features from an image without doing any processing method. In this paper, we consider the use of high level feature extraction technique to investigate the characteristic of narrow and broad weed by implementing the 2 Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform (2D-DWT) as the processing method. Most transformation techniques produce coefficient values with the same size as the original image. Further processing of the coefficient values must be applied to extract the image feature vectors. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to implement feature extraction technique using the 2D-DWT and the extracted coefficients are used to represent the image for classification of narrow and broad weed. Results obtained suggest that the extracted 2D-DWT coefficients can uniquely represents the two different weed type. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Skin is the largest human organ. It covers between 1.5 and 2 m2, comprising about one-sixth of total body weight. Skin performs a complex role in human physiology. It serves as a barrier to the environment and acts as a channel for communication to the outside world. For example, skin protects us from water loss, ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun, friction, and impact wounds. It also helps in regulating body temperature and metabolism. All photobiological responses are influenced heavily by the optical properties of skin. Therefore, for the successful development of photomedicine, in-depth knowledge and understanding of light-skin interactions, specifically known as skin optics, is required. The transfer of optical radiation into human skin depends on the absorption and scattering properties of three functional skin layers: epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. The structures and component chromophores of these layers determine the attenuation of radiation in skin. The enhanced penetration of optical radiation as well as selective targeting of pathology can be achieved by studying and analyzing the wavelength-dependent interactions of light with skin. For example, considering that melanin exhibits maximum absorption in the UV and blue spectral ranges, whereas blood preferentially absorbs blue and yellow light, the treatment protocol have been devised that target pigmented and vascular lesions, respectively.1 The chromophores, such as melanin, blood, water, and lipid determine skin absorption. Scattering largely determines the depths to which light penetrates through skin, as it dominates absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral ranges by at least one order of magnitude. It has also been shown that light scattering from dermal collagen significantly modifies skin color.2 Thus, detailed information on scattering is required for the accurate estimation of the light penetration through skin. An optical ``window'' between 600 and 1300 nm offers the possibility of treating large tissue volumes3 and using exogenous chromophores/fluorophores for contrast-enhancing.4--6 Optical imaging and spectroscopy allow for noninvasive assessment of skin pathology and treatment efficacy.7-9 In particular, reflectance imaging and spectroscopy provide information on the distribution and quantities of the scatterers and chromophores,10 whereas fluorescence responses determine the biochemical composition of the interrogated biotissue.11,12 The development of lasers and light-based medical devices has been stimulated by the achievements of diagnostic and therapeutic photomedicine.13-15 This chapter provides a brief summary and description of the properties of light, its interaction with human skin, the list of the medical light sources, and the diagnostic and/or therapeutic uses of currently available light-based devices within the visible to NIR spectral range in dermatology.},

We evaluated whether it is possible to observe a variation of skin erythema, yellowness, pigmentation, color variance and xerosis induced by the season effect and the evaluated body site by using a new ultra-high definition videodermoscope. This videodermoscope provides images independent from the external lightening and reproducible. Videodermoscopy images were acquired at three body sites (photo-exposed forearm and face and photo-protected arm) of 149 elderly healthy volunteers. 79 subjects were evaluated in March and 70 subjects were evaluated in November. We found a difference in erythema, pigmentation, xerosis and yellowness in the two groups of subjects evaluated before and after the summer. As expected, erythema, pigmentation and xerosis increased and yellowness decreased after the summer. Some differences of these parameters were found in the three body sites independently from sun exposure. Videodermoscopy can provide quantitative data about both skin color and xerosis and in the future it could be used to evaluate different cosmetics and aesthetical procedures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Actinic keratoses (AK) are pre-malignant cutaneous lesions caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation. As AKs lesions are generally accepted to be the initial lesions in a disease continuum that progresses to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), AK lesions have to be treated. They are also the second most common reason for visits to the dermatologist. Several treatments are available but their efficacy still needs to be improved. The UV-B-induced KA lesion mouse model is used in preclinical studies to assess the efficacy of novel molecules, even though it is often more representative of advanced AK or SCC. OBJECTIVES: Here we report on a translational study, comparing the various stages of AK development in humans and in the UV-B irradiated mouse model, as well as the optimization of photograph acquisition of AK lesions on mouse skin. METHODS: Human and mouse skin lesions were analysed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Mouse lesions were also assessed using a digital dermatoscope. RESULTS: An histological and phenotypic analysis, including p53, Ki67 and CD3 expression detection, performed on human and mouse AK lesions, shows that overall AK modelling in mice is relevant in the clinical situation. Some differences are observed, such as disorganization of keratinocytes of the basal layer and a number of atypical nuclei which are more numerous in human AK, whereas much more pronounced acanthosis is observed in skin lesion in mice. Thanks to this translational study, we are able to select appropriate experimental conditions for establishing either early or advanced stage AK or an SCC model. Furthermore, we optimized photograph acquisition of AK lesions on mouse skin by using a digital dermatoscope which is also used in clinics and allows reproducible photograph acquisition for further reliable assessment of mouse lesions. Use of this camera is illustrated through a pharmacological study assessing the activity of CARAC{\textregistered}. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that this mouse model of UV-B-induced skin lesions is predictive for the identification of novel therapeutic treatments for both early and advanced stages of the disease.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The incidence of cutaneous melanoma has increased over the past several decades, making its early diagnosis a continuing public health priority. The ABCD (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variegation, Diameter {\textgreater}6 mm) acronym for the appraisal of cutaneous pigmented lesions was devised in 1985 and has been widely adopted but requires reexamination in light of recent data regarding the existence of small-diameter ({\textless} or =6 mm) melanomas. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Cochrane Library and PubMed searches for the period 1980-2004 were conducted using search terms ABCD and melanoma and small-diameter melanoma. Bibliographies of retrieved articles were also used to identify additional relevant information. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Available data do not support the utility of lowering the diameter criterion of ABCD from the current greater than 6 mm guideline. However, the data support expansion to ABCDE to emphasize the significance of evolving pigmented lesions in the natural history of melanoma. Physicians and patients with nevi should be attentive to changes (evolving) of size, shape, symptoms (itching, tenderness), surface (especially bleeding), and shades of color. CONCLUSIONS: The ABCD criteria for the gross inspection of pigmented skin lesions and early diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma should be expanded to ABCDE (to include "evolving"). No change to the existing diameter criterion is required at this time.},

However, brain function in this context has only recently been demystified with the introduction of functional neuroimaging in dermatology. Functional neuroimaging, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), allows indirect visualisation of brain function. This review looks back to the beginnings of functional neuroimaging in dermatology, summarises the currently available dermatology-related fMRI studies and discusses the potential future role of fMRI as a stratifying tool in clinical dermatology and in the development of novel therapies. According to the main body of research made in this field, the focus is placed on experimental itch studies, which described the brain structures involved in itch processing, the regulation of the scratch response, contagious itch and itch suppression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Raman spectroscopy was used to discriminate human non-melanoma skin lesions from non-tumor tissues in vivo. This work proposed the discrimination between non-melanoma (basal cell carcinoma, BCC; squamous cell carcinoma, SCC) and pre-cancerous lesions (actinic keratosis, AK) from benign lesions and normal (non-tumor group, NT) tissues, using near-infrared Raman spectroscopy with a Raman probe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prior to surgery, the spectra of suspicious lesions were obtained in situ. The spectra of adjacent, clinically normal skin were also obtained. Lesions were resectioned and submitted for histopathology. The Raman spectra were measured using a Raman spectrometer (830 nm). Two types of discrimination models were developed to distinguish the different histopathological groups. The principal components analysis discriminant analysis (PCA/DA) and the partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS/DA) were based on Euclidean, quadratic and Mahalanobis distances. RESULTS: PCA and PLS spectral vectors showed spectral features of skin constituents, such as lipids (between 1,250 cm(-1) and 1,300 cm(-1) and at 1,450 cm(-1)) and proteins (between 870 cm(-1) and 940 cm(-1), 1,240 cm(-1) and 1,271 cm(-1), and at 1,000 cm(-1) and 1,450 cm(-1)). Despite the small spectral differences between malignant lesions and benign tissues, the algorithms discriminated the spectra of non-melanoma skin and pre-cancerous lesions from benign and normal tissues, with an overall accuracy of 82.8{\%} and 91.9{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSION: PCA and PLS could discriminate Raman spectra of skin tissues, opening the way for an in vivo optical diagnosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nonmelanoma skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are the most common skin cancers, presenting nearly as many cases as all other cancers combined. The current gold-standard for clinical diagnosis of these lesions is histopathologic examination, an invasive, time-consuming procedure. There is thus considerable interest in developing a real-time, automated, noninvasive tool for nonmelanoma skin cancer diagnosis. In this study, we explored the capability of Raman microspectroscopy to provide differential diagnosis of BCC, SCC, inflamed scar tissue, and normal tissue in vivo. STUDY DESIGN: Based on the results of previous in vitro studies, we developed a portable confocal Raman system with a handheld probe for clinical study. Using this portable system, we measured Raman spectra of 21 suspected nonmelanoma skin cancers in 19 patients with matched normal skin spectra. These spectra were input into nonlinear diagnostic algorithms to predict pathological designation. RESULTS: All of the BCC (9/9), SCC (4/4), and inflamed scar tissues (8/8) were correctly predicted by the diagnostic algorithm, and 19 out of 21 normal tissues were correctly classified. This translates into a 100{\%} (21/21) sensitivity and 91{\%} (19/21) specificity for abnormality, with a 95{\%} (40/42) overall classification accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal Raman microspectroscopy to be a viable tool for real-time diagnosis and guidance of nonmelanoma skin cancer resection.},

The probe design is optimized for epithelial sensitivity, whereby a large part of the detected signal originates from within the epidermal layer's depth down to the basal membrane where early stages of skin cancer develop.

In vivo confocal scanning laser microscopy is an imaging modality that provides optical sections of the skin without physically dissecting the tissue. A combination of both techniques in a single instrument is described. This combination allows the skin morphology to be visualized and (subsurface) structures in the skin to be targeted for Raman measurements. Novel results are presented that show detailed in vivo concentration profiles of water and of natural moisturizing factor for the stratum corneum that are directly related to the skin architecture by in vivo cross-sectional images of the skin. Targeting of skin structures is demonstrated by recording in vivo Raman spectra of sweat ducts and sebaceous glands in situ. In vivo measurements on dermal capillaries yielded high-quality Raman spectra of blood in a completely noninvasive manner. From the results of this exploratory study we conclude that the technique presented has great potential for fundamental skin research, pharmacology (percutaneous transport), clinical dermatology, and cosmetic research, as well as for noninvasive analysis of blood analytes, including glucose.},

@article{Cammarota1998,
abstract = {Objective: The diagnosis of most skin diseases, both focal and diffuse, has long relied mainly on physical examination findings. The recent introduction of technologically advanced ultrasound equipment using 20 MHz probes has permitted the specific application of ultrasound to dermatology. Accordingly, we investigated whether the findings at very high frequencies can represent a valid adjunct to clinical assessment in many skin conditions, including neoplasms, inflammatory states and diseases of unknown origin. Materials and methods: Skin lesions are studied using high frequency probes, which very clearly detail the three layers (epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissues) forming the normal skin. The choice of the probes frequency should depend mainly on the lesion diameters and site. Electronic 7.5–13 MHz linear probes depict flat and regular surfaces effectively and provide a wider field of surface vision and, therefore, a wider view than sectorial probes. Water bath sectorial mechanical probes with 10–20 MHz frequency have very superficial focusing and are excellent to study irregular surfaces. Results: High frequency ultrasound can be usefully correlated with clinical tests to study focal skin lesions. The diagnosis of most benign skin cancers is usually made on clinical bases. Ultrasound examinations are performed preoperatively in questionable cases. Malignant neoplasms appear at ultrasound as hypoechoic focal lesions, generally with no specific features in relation to the histologic type; nevertheless, preoperative ultrasound may play an important role in that it measures the thickness of cutaneous melanoma, which is a very important prognostic factor. In particular, 20 MHz probes permit to assess the depth of melanoma invasion. The sonographic evaluation of melanoma thickness is usually in agreement with histologic findings. ‘Satellite' neoplastic lesions growing near the main tumor can also be revealed. Color and power doppler studies may be combined with gray-scale imaging: the identification of abnormal intra- or peritumoral low-resistance pulsatile flow signals suggests the malignant nature of the cutaneous lesion. High frequency ultrasound can also be used to study diffuse cutaneous conditions. Among them, ultrasound can provide a valid morphologic representation of psoriatic skin lesions and it is also a noninvasive and accurate method for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antipsoriatic drugs. In scleroderma, sonographic findings vary depending on disease activity and the patterns vary; therefore, 20 MHz probes may also prove useful over the other instrumental tools to monitor the disease course and treatment efficacy in focal scleroderma. Other potential applications include allergic dermatitis, nodular erythema, dermatomyosis, sarcoidosis, lymphedema of the limbs and allergologic conditions. Ultrasound can also be used in monitoring the response to or complications of topic drugs administration, and in the follow-up of focal burns. Conclusion: High frequency ultrasound can provide a reliable morphologic representation of skin lesions but it is also an accurate noninvasive tool for monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of drugs administration in focal or diffuse diseases. The application of high frequency studies to dermatology is very challenging. Indeed, the very high frequency probes up to 20 MHz currently available are particularly useful for reliable studies. Contrast-enhanced color and power doppler are very promising techniques. Advancements in technology will improve the correlation of clinical with high frequency ultrasound findings in the assessment of several skin diseases.},

abstract = {The bag-of-words model is one of the most popular representation methods for object categorization. The key idea is to quantize each extracted key point into one of visual words, and then represent each image by a histogram of the visual words. For this purpose, a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means), is generally used for generating the visual words. Although a number of studies have shown encouraging results of the bag-of-words representation for object categorization, theoretical studies on properties of the bag-of-words model is almost untouched, possibly due to the difficulty introduced by using a heuristic clustering process. In this paper, we present a statistical framework which generalizes the bag-of-words representation. In this framework, the visual words are generated by a statistical process rather than using a clustering algorithm, while the empirical performance is competitive to clustering-based method. A theoretical analysis based on statistical consistency is presented for the proposed framework. Moreover, based on the framework we developed two algorithms which do not rely on clustering, while achieving competitive performance in object categorization when compared to clustering-based bag-of-words representations.},

We firstly use evolution strategies find the optimal points of hyperparameters and secondly execute a grid search in the neighborhood of these points.

@article{Tsamardinos2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.In a typical supervised data analysis task, one needs to perform the following two tasks: (a) select an optimal combination of learning methods (e.g., for variable selection and classifier) and tune their hyper-parameters (e.g., K in K-NN), also called model selection, and (b) provide an estimate of the performance of the final, reported model. Combining the two tasks is not trivial because when one selects the set of hyper-parameters that seem to provide the best estimated performance, this estimation is optimistic (biased/overfitted) due to performing multiple statistical comparisons. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical properties of performance estimation when model selection is present and we confirm that the simple Cross-Validation with model selection is indeed optimistic (overestimates performance) in small sample scenarios and should be avoided. We present in detail and investigate the theoretical properties of the Nested Cross Validation and a method by Tibshirani and Tibshirani for removing the estimation bias. In computational experiments with real datasets both protocols provide conservative estimation of performance and should be preferred. These statements hold true even if feature selection is performed as preprocessing.},

abstract = {We consider the accuracy estimation of a classifier constructed on a given training sample. The naive resubstitution estimate is known to have a downward bias problem. The traditional approach to tackling this bias problem is cross-validation. The bootstrap is another way to bring down the high variability of cross-validation. But a direct comparison of the two estimators, cross-validation and bootstrap, is not fair because the latter estimator requires much heavier computation. We performed an empirical study to compare the .632+ bootstrap estimator with the repeated 10-fold cross-validation and the repeated one-third holdout estimator. All the estimators were set to require about the same amount of computation. In the simulation study, the repeated 10-fold cross-validation estimator was found to have better performance than the .632+ bootstrap estimator when the classifier is highly adaptive to the training sample. We have also found that the .632+ bootstrap estimator suffers from a bias problem for large samples as well as for small samples. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias $\backslash$nand variance components.

PCA is used to fuse multidimensional feature information into a more compact representation while the ICA is applied to extract patterns containing independent low level information about the situation. The results show that a few principal components compress the situation data representation efficiently. In addition, principal component representation provides a method for visualizing high level situation information. Most independent components extracted from the usage situation data correlate strongly with some of the original signals.

We have proposed and tested weak classifiers based on linear support vector machines (SVM) and region distances provided by descriptors. The experiments were performed on a large image of coffee plantations. We have shown in this paper that our approach based on boosting can detect the scale and set of features best suited to a particular training set. We have also shown that hierarchical multiscale analysis is able to reduce training time and to produce a stronger classifier.

abstract = {Histopathological images are the gold standard for breast cancer diagnosis. During examination several dozens of them are acquired for a single patient. Conventional, image-based classification systems make the assumption that all the patient's images have the same label as the patient, which is rarely verified in practice since labeling the data is expensive. We propose a weakly supervised learning framework and investigate the relevance of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer patients, based on the analysis of histopathological images. Multiple instance learning consists in organizing instances (images) into bags (patients), without the need to label all the instances. We compare several state-of-the-art MIL methods including the pioneering ones (APR, Diverse Density, MI-SVM, citation-kNN), and more recent ones such as a non parametric method and a deep learning based approach (MIL-CNN). The experiments are conducted on the public BreaKHis dataset which contains about 8000 microscopic biopsy images of benign and malignant breast tumors, originating from 82 patients. Among the MIL methods the non-parametric approach has the best overall results, and in some cases allows to obtain classification rates never reached by conventional (single instance) classification frameworks. The comparison between MIL and single instance classification reveals the relevance of the MIL paradigm for the task at hand. In particular, the MIL allows to obtain comparable or better results than conventional (single instance) classification without the need to label all the images.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {Human detection is fundamental in many machine vision applications, like video surveillance, driving assistance, action recognition and scene understanding. However in most of these applications real-time performance is necessary and this is not achieved yet by current detection methods. This paper presents a new method for human detection based on a multiresolution cascade of Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) that can highly reduce the computational cost of detection search without affecting accuracy. The method consists of a cascade of sliding window detectors. Each detector is a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) composed of HOG features at different resolutions, from coarse at the first level to fine at the last one. In contrast to previous methods, our approach uses a non-uniform stride of the sliding window that is defined by the feature resolution and allows the detection to be incrementally refined as going from coarse-to-fine resolution. In this way, the speed-up of the cascade is not only due to the fewer number of features computed at the first levels of the cascade, but also to the reduced number of windows that need to be evaluated at the coarse resolution. Experimental results show that our method reaches a detection rate comparable with the state-of-the-art of detectors based on HOG features, while at the same time the detection search is up to 23 times faster.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are state-of-the-art models for many image classification tasks. However, to recognize cancer subtypes automatically, training a CNN on gigapixel resolution Whole Slide Tissue Images (WSI) is currently computationally impossible. The differentiation of cancer subtypes is based on cellular-level visual features observed on image patch scale. Therefore, we argue that in this situation, training a patch-level classifier on image patches will perform better than or similar to an image-level classifier. The challenge becomes how to intelligently combine patch-level classification results and model the fact that not all patches will be discriminative. We propose to train a decision fusion model to aggregate patch-level predictions given by patch-level CNNs, which to the best of our knowledge has not been shown before. Furthermore, we formulate a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) based method that automatically locates discriminative patches robustly by utilizing the spatial relationships of patches. We apply our method to the classification of glioma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma cases into subtypes. The classification accuracy of our method is similar to the inter-observer agreement between pathologists. Although it is impossible to train CNNs on WSIs, we experimentally demonstrate using a comparable non-cancer dataset of smaller images that a patch-based CNN can outperform an image-based CNN.},

Generally, the different backgrounds in which the objects of interest are contained significantly dwindle the performance of vision systems. In this work, we design a sliding windows machine learning system for the recognition and detection of left ventricles in MR cardiac images. We leverage on the capability of artificial neural networks to cope with some of the inevitable scene constraints encountered in medical objects detection tasks. We train a backpropagation neural network on samples of left and nonleft ventricles. We reformulate the left ventricles detection task as a machine learning problem and employ an intelligent system (backpropagation neural network) to achieve the detection task. We treat the left ventricle detection problem as binary classification tasks by assigning collected left ventricle samples as one class, and random (nonleft ventricles) objects are the other class. The trained backpropagation neural network is validated to possess a good generalization power by simulating it with a test set. A recognition rate of 100{\&}{\#}x25; and 88{\&}{\#}x25; is achieved on the training and test set, respectively. The trained backpropagation neural network is used to determine if the sampled region in a target image contains a left ventricle or not. Lastly, we show the effectiveness of the proposed system by comparing the manual detection of left ventricles drawn by medical experts and the automatic detection by the trained network.},

CXR images of 6069 healthy subjects and 3417 patients at AMC and 1035 healthy subjects and 4404 patients at SNUBH were obtained. Our approach involved two steps. First, the regional patterns of thoracic abnormalities were identified by initial learning of patch images around abnormal lesions. Second, Resnet-50 was fine-tuned using the entire images. The network was weakly trained and modified to detect various disease patterns. Finally, class activation maps (CAM) were extracted to localise and visualise the abnormal patterns. For average disease, the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were 85.4{\%}, 99.8{\%}, and 0.947, respectively, in the AMC dataset and 97.9{\%}, 100.0{\%}, and 0.983, respectively, in the SNUBH dataset. This curriculum learning and weak labelling with high-scale CXR images requires less preparation to train the system and could be easily extended to include various diseases in actual clinical environments. This algorithm performed well for the detection and classification of five disease patterns in CXR images and could be helpful in image interpretation.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) require large image corpora to be trained on classification tasks. The variation in image resolutions, sizes of objects and patterns depicted, and image scales, hampers CNN training and performance, because the task-relevant information varies over spatial scales. Previous work attempting to deal with such scale variations focused on encouraging scale-invariant CNN representations. However, scale-invariant representations are incomplete representations of images, because images contain scale-variant information as well. This paper addresses the combined development of scale-invariant and scale-variant representations. We propose a multi-scale CNN method to encourage the recognition of both types of features and evaluate it on a challenging image classification task involving task-relevant characteristics at multiple scales. The results show that our multi-scale CNN outperforms single-scale CNN. This leads to the conclusion that encouraging the combined development of a scale-invariant and scale-variant representation in CNNs is beneficial to image recognition performance.},

abstract = {Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective inductive learning
algorithms for machine learning and data mining. Its competitive
performance in classification is surprising, because the conditional
independence assumption on which it is based, is rarely true in realworld
applications. An open question is: what is the true reason for the
surprisingly good performance of naive Bayes in classification? In
this paper, we propose a novel explanation on the superb classification
performance of naive Bayes. We show that, essentially, the dependence
distribution; i.e., how the local dependence of a node distributes
in each class, evenly or unevenly, and how the local dependencies
of all nodes work together, consistently (supporting a certain classification)
or inconsistently (canceling each other out), plays a crucial role.
Therefore, no matter how strong the dependences among attributes
are, naive Bayes can still be optimal if the dependences distribute
evenly in classes, or if the dependences cancel each other out. We
propose and prove a sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimality
of naive Bayes. Further, we investigate the optimality of naive Bayes
under the Gaussian distribution. We present and prove a sufficient
condition for the optimality of naive Bayes, in which the dependence
between attributes do exist. This provides evidence that dependence
among attributes may cancel out each other. In addition, we explore
when naive Bayes works well.},
