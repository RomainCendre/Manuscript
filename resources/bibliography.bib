abstract = {A number of noninvasive approaches have been developed over the years to provide objective evaluation of the skin both in health and in disease. The advent of computers, as well as of lasers and photonics, has made it possible to develop additional techniques that were impossible a few years ago. These approaches provide the dermatologist with sensitive tools to measure the skin's condition in terms of physiologic parameters (e.g., color, erythema and pigmentation, induration, sebaceous and stratum corneum lipids, barrier function, etc.). Yet, a typical dermatologic diagnosis relies primarily on the trained eyes of the physician and to a lesser extent on information from other senses, such as touch and smell. The trained senses of the dermatologist backed by his/her brain form a powerful set of tools for evaluating the skin. The golden rule in diagnosis remains the histologic examination of a skin biopsy, a rather invasive method. These tools have served the profession well. The advent of ever faster and cheaper computers and of sensitive, inexpensive optical instrumentation of minimal dimensions provides the professional with the possibility of making objective measures of a number of skin parameters.},

In a 70-kg individual, the skin weighs over 5 kg and covers a surface area approaching 2 m 2 . Human skin consists of a stratifi ed, cellular epidermis and an underlying dermis of connective tissue (Fig. 3.1). Beneath the dermis is a layer of subcutaneous fat, which is separated from the rest of the body by a vestigial layer of striated muscle. The epidermis is mainly composed of keratinocytes and is typi-cally 0.05–0.1 mm in thickness. It is formed by division of cells in the basal layer which give rise to the spinous layer. This layer contains cells that move outwards and progressively differentiate, forming the granular layer and the stratum corneum. The cellular progression from the basal layer to the skin surface takes about 30 days but is accelerated in diseases such as psoriasis. The 'brick-like' shape of keratinocytes is provided by a cytoskeleton made of keratin intermediate fi laments. As the epidermis differentiates, the keratinocytes become fl attened. This process involves the fi lament aggregating protein, fi laggrin, a protein component of keratohya-lin granules. Indeed, keratin and fi laggrin comprise 80–90{\%} of the mass of the epidermis. The outermost layer of the epidermis is the stratum corneum, where cells (now called corneocytes) have lost nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles. The corneocyte has a highly insoluble, cornifi ed envelope within the plasma membrane, formed by cross-linking of soluble protein precursors, including involucrin and loricrin, the latter contributing 70–85{\%} to the mass of the cornifi ed cell envelope; it also contains several lipids (fatty acids, sterols and ceramides) released from lamellar bodies within the upper, living epidermis. Other cells in the epidermis are the melanocytes, Langerhans' cells and Merkel cells. Melanocytes are dendritic cells that distribute packages of melanin pigment in melanosomes to surrounding keratinocytes to give skin its colour. The number of melanocytes does not differ much between white and black skin. Rather it is the nature of the melanin and the size of the melanosomes that account for the different appearances. The Langerhans' cells are also dendritic in nature, although these are of mesenchymal origin and originate from bone marrow. Langerhans' cells are antigen-presenting cells and process anti-gens encountered by the skin to local lymph nodes and thus have a key role in adaptive immune responses in the skin. Merkel cells are probably derived from keratinocytes. They have a role as mechanosensory receptors in response to touch. Human skin contains pilosebaceous follicles and sweat glands. The hair follicles comprise pockets of epithelium that are continu-ous with the superfi cial epidermis but which also envelop a small papilla of dermis at their base. A bundle of smooth muscle, the arrector pili, extends at an angle between the surface of the dermis and a point in the follicle wall. Above the insertion, there are holocrine sebaceous glands which open into the pilary canal. In some sites, such as the axillae, the follicles may be associated with apocrine glands. Also derived from the epidermis and opening directly to the skin surface are the eccrine sweat glands. The epidermis is attached to the dermis via a complex network of proteins and glycoproteins that extend from inside basal},

abstract = {Lentigo maligna melanoma is an increasingly common melanoma subtype worldwide, occurring mainly on the head and neck of older, light-skinned individuals. This subtype poses specific challenges in diagnosis and management, including histologic differentiation from surrounding sun-damaged skin with atypical melanocytes, optimizing treatment in anatomically constrained sites where this melanoma subtype tends to occur, and reducing local recurrence rates related to subclinical extensions, all while taking into account quality of life issues and suitability of surgical, topical, and/or radiation therapy in an elderly population. Noninvasive tools such as dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy can facilitate early diagnosis. Treatment options include surgical and nonsurgical modalities which are complicated by frequent subclinical extension of the tumor and more complex anatomic location. Surgical options include conventional wide excision and techniques that provide exhaustive peripheral margin control, including staged excision with permanent sections and Mohs micrographic surgery, both of which may reduce rates of local recurrence. Nonsurgical therapies include off-label topical imiquimod and radiation therapy, which are generally second-line but may be preferable in certain instances based on patient comorbidities and/or limited life expectancy, quality of life issues, and/or preference for nonsurgical treatment. Recurrence may occur years after initial treatment, necessitating the need for long-term follow-up.},

abstract = {Abstract   This paper is about generalized Fourier descriptors, and their application to the research of invariants under group actions. A general methodology is developed, crucially related to Pontryagin's, Tannaka's, Chu's and Tatsuuma's dualities, from abstract harmonic analysis. Application to motion groups provides a general methodology for pattern recognition. This methodology generalizes the classical basic method of Fourier-invariants of contours of objects. In the paper, we use the results of this theory, inside a Support-Vector-Machine context, for 3D objects-recognition. As usual in practice, we classify 3D objects starting from 2D information. However our method is rather general and could be applied directly to 3D data, in other contexts. Our applications and comparisons with other methods are about human-face recognition, but also we provide tests and comparisons based upon standard data-bases such as the COIL data-base. Our methodology looks extremely efficient, and effective computations are rather simple and low cost. The paper is divided in two parts: first, the part relative to applications and computations, in a SVM environment. The second part is devoted to the development of the general theory of generalized Fourier-descriptors, with several new results, about their completeness in particular. These results lead to simple formulas for motion-invariants of images, that are {\^{a}} complete{\^{a}} in a certain sense, and that are used in the first part of the paper. The computation of these invariants requires only standard FFT estimations, and one dimensional integration.},

abstract = {Background: The identification of "normal" dermoscopic patterns of acquired melanocytic nevi provides better diagnostic accuracy for melanoma in people with black skin. Objective: We sought to describe melanocytic lesions (numbers and anatomic distributions) in skin types V and VI compared with skin types I and II, according to the Fitzpatrick classification. We sought to identify differences in dermoscopic findings in acquired melanocytic nevi (global pattern, pigment and color distribution) between the groups. Methods: We conducted cross-sectional, prospective, and consecutive data collection in 2 dermatologic outpatient clinics, between October 8, 2010, and March 20, 2013. From the 501 volunteers, 480 participants fulfilled the eligibility criteria. A total of 460 acquired melanocytic nevi were selected for dermoscopic analysis. Results: Individuals with skin type V/VI had fewer melanocytic lesions than those with skin type I/II (15.08 vs 7.90; P = .032), and the anatomic distribution in the first group was predominantly on the face and acral sites (P {\textless} .001). The acquired melanocytic nevi in the skin type V/VI group were associated with the reticular pattern (P {\textless} .0001), with a tendency toward central hyperpigmentation (P = .0025). Limitations: The choice of a single representative nevus per patient is a limitation. Conclusions: Acquired melanocytic nevi in individuals with skin type V/VI have a distinct dermoscopic pattern from those with skin type I/II.},

These two procedures are in some cases solving equivalent problems, but with quite different algorithms. In this article we bring the two approaches together, leading to an efficient algorithm for large matrix factorization and completion that outperforms both of these.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite recent improvements in prevention, diagnosis and treatment, vast differences in melanoma burden still exist between populations. Comparative data can highlight these differences and lead to focused efforts to reduce the burden of melanoma. OBJECTIVES To assess global, regional and national melanoma incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015. METHODS Vital registration system and cancer registry data were used for melanoma mortality modelling. Incidence and prevalence were estimated using separately modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios. Total prevalence was divided into four disease phases and multiplied by disability weights to generate years lived with disability (YLDs). Deaths in each age group were multiplied by the reference life expectancy to generate years of life lost (YLLs). YLDs and YLLs were added to estimate DALYs. RESULTS The five world regions with the greatest melanoma incidence, DALY and mortality rates were Australasia, North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Central Europe. With the exception of regions in sub-Saharan Africa, DALY and mortality rates were greater in men than in women. DALY rate by age was highest in those aged 75-79 years, 70-74 years and ≥ 80 years. CONCLUSIONS The greatest burden from melanoma falls on Australasian, North American, European, elderly and male populations, which is consistent with previous investigations. These substantial disparities in melanoma burden worldwide highlight the need for aggressive prevention efforts. The Global Burden of Disease Study results can help shape melanoma research and public policy.},

In vivo tumor model was made by inoculating human glioma cell line U87-MG subcutaneously in nude mice. The tumor was sonicated by 25-kHz ultrasound 4 hours following administration of 5-ALA. The tumor size decreased in 5-ALA administered (ALA(+)US(+)) mice, while increased in non-5-ALA administrated (ALA(-)US(+)) mice and non-sonicated mice (ALA(+)US(-)). The immunohistochemical analysis revealed an apoptotic change in tumor tissue of ALA(+)US(+) mice. The results showed the therapeutic effect of 25 kHz ultrasound for the glioma in 5-ALA administered tumor-bearing mice by inducing apoptotic change of tumor cells. This is a first report to elucidate the feasibility of therapeutic use of 25 kHz, relatively low frequency, ultrasound in sonodynamic therapy using 5-ALA as a sonosensitizer precursor. The utilization of this frequency will contribute to the development of sonodynamic therapy for gliomas and the spread of this technique in many hospitals that possess ultrasonic aspirators.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in fair-skinned populations in many parts of the world. The incidence, morbidity and mortality rates of skin cancers are increasing and, therefore, pose a significant public health concern. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the major etiologic agent in the development of skin cancers. UVR causes DNA damage and genetic mutations, which subsequently lead to skin cancer. A clearer understanding of UVR is crucial in the prevention of skin cancer. This article reviews UVR, its damaging effects on the skin and its relationship to UV immunosuppression and skin cancer. Several factors influence the amount of UVR reaching the earth's surface, including ozone depletion, UV light elevation, latitude, altitude, and weather conditions. The current treatment modalities utilizing UVR (i.e. phototherapy) can also predispose to skin cancers. Unnecessary exposure to the sun and artificial UVR (tanning lamps) are important personal attributable risks. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of skin cancer with an emphasis on carefully evaluated statistics, the epidemiology of UVR-induced skin cancers, incidence rates, risk factors, and preventative behaviors {\&} strategies, including personal behavioral modifications and public educational initiatives.},

abstract = {This paper describes the histogenesis of 3 forms of human malignant melanoma: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, and lentigo maligna melanoma. A comparative analysis by computer of the biologic behavior and clinical characteristics of the different neoplasms has been done. An additional 60 tumors have been studied by serial block section ing. Evidence is presented suggesting that superficial spreading melanoma and lentigo maligna melanoma (Hutchinson's mela notic freckle), though evolving at different rates, show a long period of superficial growth, followed by the relatively rapid appearance of nodules or deeper invasion within the primary lesion. This change in the nature of the primary lesion may be due to the appearance of one or more strains of cells of aggres sive biologic potential. Thus the primary melanoma may exist for a relatively long period of time during which host selec tional forces act to permit the growth of quite malignant strains of cells. It is these cells that seem to be capable of deeper growth. The subdivision of each of the forms of mela noma into 5 anatomic levels of invasion permits the accurate assignment of prognosis to each case. It is suggested that mela nomas are tumors of the epidermal melanocytes and are not necessarily derived from melanocytic nevi. Each melanoma has a distinctive clinical appearance, even in its superficial and curable phases, and this appearance is the same whether or not the process arose in association with a melanocytic nevus.},

Biopsies from three different body sites of 71 human volunteers were obtained, and thickness of the stratum corneum and cellular epidermis was measured microscopically using a preparation technique preventing tissue damage. Multiple regressions analysis was used to evaluate the effect of the various factors independently of each other. Mean (SD) thickness of the stratum corneum was 18.3 (4.9) mmat the dorsal aspect of the forearm, 11.0 (2.2) mm at the shoulder and 14.9 (3.4) mm at the buttock. Corresponding values for the cellular epidermis were 56.6 (11.5) mm, 70.3 (13.6) mm and 81.5 (15.7) mm, respectively. Body site largely explains the variation in epidermal thickness, but also a significant individual variation was observed. Thickness of the stratum corneum correlated positively to pigmentation ( p{\~{}}0.0008) and negatively to the number of years of smoking ( pv0.0001).

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is used for quick medical checkups. The aim of this study is to check the discrimination power of texture features for the automatic identification of diagnostic significant regions in CLSM views of skin lesions. METHODS: In tissue counter analysis (TCA) the images are dissected in equal square elements, where different classes of features are calculated out. Features defined in the spatial domain are based on histogram (grey level distribution) and co-occurrence matrix (grey level combinations). The features defined in the frequency domain are based on spectral properties of the wavelet Daubechie 4 transform (texture exploration at different scales) and the Fourier transform (global texture properties are localized in the spectrum). Hundred cases of benign common nevi and malignant melanoma were used as the study set. Classification was done with CART (Classification and Regression Trees) analysis which splits the set of square elements into homogenous terminal nodes and generates a set of splitting rules. RESULTS: Features based on the wavelet transform provide the best results with 96.0{\%} of correctly classified elements from benign common nevi and 97.0{\%} from malignant melanoma. The classification results are relocated to the images by use of the splitting rules as diagnostic aid. The discriminated square elements are highlighted in the images, showing tissue with features in good accordance with typical diagnostic CLSM features. CONCLUSION: Square elements with more than 80{\%} of discrimination power enable the identification of diagnostic highly significant parts in confocal microscopic views of malignant melanoma.},

However, no study compared the diagnostic accuracy of these techniques. Objective: We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM for LM/LMM using a holistic assessment of the images. Methods: A total of 223 facial lesions were evaluated by 21 experts. Diagnostic accuracy of the clinical, dermoscopic and RCM examination was compared. Interinvestigator variability and confidence level in the diagnosis were also evaluated. Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy of the two imaging techniques was good (area under the curve of the sROC function: 0.89). RCM was more sensitive (80{\%}, vs. 61{\%}) and less specific (81{\%} vs. 92{\%}) than dermoscopy for LM/LMM. In particular, RCM showed a higher sensitivity for hypomelanotic and recurrent LM/LMM. RCM had a higher interinvestigator agreement and a higher confidence level in the diagnosis than dermoscopy. Conclusion: Reflectance confocal microscopy and dermoscopy are both useful techniques for the diagnosis of facial lesions and in particular LM/LMM. RCM is particularly suitable for the identification of hypomelanotic and recurrent LM/LMM.},

abstract = {This work presents a generic computer vision system designed for exploiting trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a generic feature extractor and mixing these features with more traditional hand-crafted features. Such a system is a single structure that can be used for synthesizing a large number of different image classification tasks. Three substructures are proposed for creating the generic computer vision system starting from handcrafted and non-handcrafter features: i) one that remaps the output layer of a trained CNN to classify a different problem using an SVM; ii) a second for exploiting the output of the penultimate layer of a trained CNN as a feature vector to feed an SVM; and iii) a third for merging the output of some deep layers, applying a dimensionality reduction method, and using these features as the input to an SVM. The application of feature transform techniques to reduce the dimensionality of feature sets coming from the deep layers represents one of the main contributions of this paper. Three approaches are used for the non-handcrafted features: deep transfer learning features based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), principal component analysis network (PCAN), and the compact binary descriptor (CBD). For the handcrafted features, a wide variety of state-of-the-art algorithms are considered: Local Ternary Patterns, Local Phase Quantization, Rotation Invariant Co-occurrence Local Binary Patterns, Completed Local Binary Patterns, Rotated local binary pattern image, Globally Rotation Invariant Multi-scale Co-occurrence Local Binary Pattern, and several others. The computer vision system based on the proposed approach was tested on many different datasets, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed approach thanks to the strong performance recorded. The Wilcoxon signed rank test is used to compare the different methods; moreover, the independence of the different methods is studied using the Q-statistic. To facilitate replication of our experiments, the MATLAB source code will be available at (https://www.dropbox.com/s/bguw035yrqz0pwp/ElencoCode.docx?dl=0).},

@article{Dasarathy1997,
abstract = {Sensor fusion models have been characterized in the literature in a number of distinctly different ways: in terms of information levels at which the fusion is accomplished; the objectives of the fusion process, the application domain; the types of sensors employed, the sensor suite configuration and so on. The characterization most commonly encountered in the rapidly growing sensor fusion literature based on level of detail in the information is that of the now well known triplet: data level, feature level, and decision level. We consider here a generalized input-output (I/O) descriptor pair based characterization of the sensor fusion process that can be looked upon as a natural out growth of the trilevel characterization. The fusion system design philosophy expounded here is that an exhaustive exploitation of the sensor fusion potential should explore fusion under all of the different I/O-based fusion modes conceivable under such a characterization. Fusion system architectures designed to permit such exploitation offer the requisite flexibility for developing the most effective fusion system designs for a given application. A second facet of this exploitation is aimed at exploring the new concept of self-improving multisensor fusion system architectures wherein the central (fusion system) and focal (individual sensor subsystems) decision makers mutually enhance the other's performance by providing reinforced learning. A third facet is that of investigating fusion system architectures for environments wherein the different local decision makers may only be capable of narrower decisions that span only a subset of decision choices. The paper discusses these flexible fusion system architectures along with related issues and illustrates them with examples of their application to real-world scenarios.},

abstract = {MOST verbal communication occurs in contexts where the listener can see the speaker as well as hear him. However, speech perception is normally regarded as a purely auditory process. The study reported here demonstrates a previously unrecognised influence of vision upon speech perception. It stems from an observation that, on being shown a film of a young woman's talking head, in which repeated utterances of the syllable [ba] had been dubbed on to lip movements for [ga], normal adults reported hearing [da]. With the reverse dubbing process, a majority reported hearing [bagba] or [gaba]. When these subjects listened to the soundtrack from the film, without visual input, or when they watched untreated film, they reported the syllables accurately as repetitions of [ba] or [ga]. Subsequent replications confirm the reliability of these findings; they have important implications for the understanding of speech perception. {\textcopyright} 1976 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Lentigo maligna is the most common type of facial melanoma. Diagnosis is complicated, however, as it shares clinical and dermoscopic characteristics with other cutaneous lesions of the face. Reflectance confocal microscopy is an imaging technique that permits the visualization of characteristic features of lentigo maligna. These include a disrupted honeycomb pattern and pagetoid cells with a tendency to show folliculotropism. These cells typically have a dendritic morphology, although they may also appear as round cells measuring over 20$\mu$m with atypical nuclei. Poorly defined dermal papillae and atypical cells may be seen at the dermal-epidermal junction and can form bridges resembling mitochondrial structures. Other characteristic findings include junctional swelling with atypical cells located around the follicles, resembling caput medusae. Reflectance confocal microscopy is a very useful tool for diagnosing lentigo maligna. ER},

A total of 64 RCM features were scored retrospectively and blinded to diagnosis in a consecutive series of RCM sampled, clinically equivocal, macules of the face (n=81 LM, n=203 benign macules (BMs)). In addition to describing RCM diagnostic features for LM (univariate), an algorithm was developed (LM score) to distinguish LM from BM. This comprised two major features each scoring +2 points (nonedged papillae and round large pagetoid cells >20μm), and four minor features; three scored +1 point each (three or more atypical cells at the dermoepidermal junction in five 0.5 × 0.5mm2 fields, follicular localization of atypical cells, and nucleated cells within the dermal papillae), and one (negative) feature scored -1 point (a broadened honeycomb pattern). A LM score of ≥2 resulted in a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 76% for the diagnosis of LM (odds ratio (OR) for LM 18.6; 95% confidence interval: 9.3–37.1). The algorithm was equally effective in the diagnosis of amelanotic lesions and showed good interobserver reproducibility (87%). In a test set of 29 LMs and 44 BMs, the OR for LM was 60.7 (confidence interval: 11.9–309) (93% sensitivity, 82% specificity)."

The first one is based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the other is based on the Gabor filters. The two are compared for texture recognition and retrieval. To have deeper insight in to the role of neighbourhood properties and the filter banks in the texture description, extensive experimentation is performed over the image sets containing noisy and rotated variants of the textures from Brodatz album. A method for estimating rotation variance (RV) of a texture descriptor is also presented, which gives an idea of how rotation-sensitive is a certain texture descriptor. The results establish that the DFT-based features outperform the features based on Gabor filters in noiseless conditions whereas the later outperform otherwise. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called {\&}{\#}x201C;ImageNet{\&}{\#}x201D;, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},
