abstract = {In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question: Are there any benefits to combining Inception architectures with residual connections? Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and nonresidual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4 networks, we achieve 3.08{\%} top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge.},

While accuracy figures have steadily increased, the resource utilisation of winning models has not been properly taken into account. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of important metrics in practical applications: accuracy, memory footprint, parameters, operations count, inference time and power consumption. Key findings are: (1) power consumption is independent of batch size and architecture; (2) accuracy and inference time are in a hyperbolic relationship; (3) energy constraint is an upper bound on the maximum achievable accuracy and model complexity; (4) the number of operations is a reliable estimate of the inference time. We believe our analysis provides a compelling set of information that helps design and engineer efficient DNNs.},

Weight of a class is usually determined by proportion of samples in each class in training set. This paper analyzes that sample proportions of training set and testing set may vary in some range and it would compromise performance of learned classifier. This problem becomes serious when class distribution is extremely high imbalanced. Based on the analysis, an adaptive weighting approach aiming at finding a group of proper weights for classes is proposed. We employ evolutionary algorithm to optimize weight configuration to ensure overall performance of classifier in both training set and possible testing sets. Experimental results on a wide variety of datasets demonstrate that our approach could achieve better performances.},

This work classifies texture descriptor into nine groups where the extraction of features is classified using backpropagation learning with two types of multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The best texture descriptor as selected when the value of regression 1 appears in both the MLP- 1 and the MLP-2 with the number of epoches less than 1000. The results of testing show that the best selected texture descriptor is the second order (combination) using all direction that have twenty four descriptors.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The incidence of cutaneous melanoma has increased over the past several decades, making its early diagnosis a continuing public health priority. The ABCD (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variegation, Diameter {\textgreater}6 mm) acronym for the appraisal of cutaneous pigmented lesions was devised in 1985 and has been widely adopted but requires reexamination in light of recent data regarding the existence of small-diameter ({\textless} or =6 mm) melanomas. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Cochrane Library and PubMed searches for the period 1980-2004 were conducted using search terms ABCD and melanoma and small-diameter melanoma. Bibliographies of retrieved articles were also used to identify additional relevant information. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Available data do not support the utility of lowering the diameter criterion of ABCD from the current greater than 6 mm guideline. However, the data support expansion to ABCDE to emphasize the significance of evolving pigmented lesions in the natural history of melanoma. Physicians and patients with nevi should be attentive to changes (evolving) of size, shape, symptoms (itching, tenderness), surface (especially bleeding), and shades of color. CONCLUSIONS: The ABCD criteria for the gross inspection of pigmented skin lesions and early diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma should be expanded to ABCDE (to include "evolving"). No change to the existing diameter criterion is required at this time.},

abstract = {Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve$\backslash$nthe numerical optimisation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often$\backslash$nbased on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold $\backslash$ncross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias $\backslash$nand variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial $\backslash$nquality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is $\backslash$nat least as important, as a non-negligible variance introduces the potential $\backslash$nfor over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While $\backslash$nthis observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in $\backslash$nperformance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be $\backslash$nsurprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little $\backslash$nattention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show $\backslash$nthat the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable $\backslash$nmagnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus $\backslash$ncannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some $\backslash$ncommon performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection $\backslash$nbias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable.

While this study concentrates on cross-validation based $\backslash$nmodel selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model $\backslash$nselection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion $\backslash$nevaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian $\backslash$nevidence and optimisation of performance bounds.},

abstract = {Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective inductive learning
algorithms for machine learning and data mining. Its competitive
performance in classification is surprising, because the conditional
independence assumption on which it is based, is rarely true in realworld
applications. An open question is: what is the true reason for the
surprisingly good performance of naive Bayes in classification? In
this paper, we propose a novel explanation on the superb classification
performance of naive Bayes. We show that, essentially, the dependence
distribution; i.e., how the local dependence of a node distributes
in each class, evenly or unevenly, and how the local dependencies
of all nodes work together, consistently (supporting a certain classification)
or inconsistently (canceling each other out), plays a crucial role.
Therefore, no matter how strong the dependences among attributes
are, naive Bayes can still be optimal if the dependences distribute
evenly in classes, or if the dependences cancel each other out. We
propose and prove a sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimality
of naive Bayes. Further, we investigate the optimality of naive Bayes
under the Gaussian distribution. We present and prove a sufficient
condition for the optimality of naive Bayes, in which the dependence
between attributes do exist. This provides evidence that dependence
among attributes may cancel out each other. In addition, we explore
when naive Bayes works well.},

abstract = {For optimal decision making under variable class distributions and misclassification costs a classifier needs to produce well-calibrated estimates of the posterior probability. Isotonic calibration is a powerful non-parametric method that is however prone to overfitting on smaller datasets; hence a parametric method based on the logistic curve is commonly used. While logistic calibration is designed for normally distributed per-class scores, we demonstrate experimentally that many classifiers including Naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from a particular distortion where these score distributions are heavily skewed. In such cases logistic calibration can easily yield probability estimates that are worse than the original scores. Moreover, the logistic curve family does not include the identity function, and hence logistic calibration can easily uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated classifier. In this paper we solve all these problems with a richer class of calibration maps based on the beta distribution. We derive the method from first principles and show that fitting it is as easy as fitting a logistic curve. Extensive experiments show that beta calibration is superior to logistic calibration for Naive Bayes and Adaboost.},

@article{Naeini2015,
abstract = {Learning probabilistic predictive models that are well calibrated is critical for many prediction and decision-making tasks in artificial intelligence. In this paper we present a new non-parametric calibration method called Bayesian Binning into Quantiles (BBQ) which addresses key limitations of existing calibration methods. The method post processes the output of a binary classification algorithm; thus, it can be readily combined with many existing classification algorithms. The method is computationally tractable, and empirically accurate, as evidenced by the set of experiments reported here on both real and simulated datasets.},
