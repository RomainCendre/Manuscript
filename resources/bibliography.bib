abstract = {We investigated the feasibility of sonodynamic therapy for glioma by low frequency ultrasoundwith5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a precursor of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in heme synthetic process. In vivo tumor model was made by inoculating human glioma cell line U87-MG subcutaneously in nude mice. The tumor was sonicated by 25-kHz ultrasound 4 hours following administration of 5-ALA. The tumor size decreased in 5-ALA administered (ALA(+)US(+)) mice, while increased in non-5-ALA administrated (ALA(-)US(+)) mice and non-sonicated mice (ALA(+)US(-)). The immunohistochemical analysis revealed an apoptotic change in tumor tissue of ALA(+)US(+) mice. The results showed the therapeutic effect of 25 kHz ultrasound for the glioma in 5-ALA administered tumor-bearing mice by inducing apoptotic change of tumor cells. This is a first report to elucidate the feasibility of therapeutic use of 25 kHz, relatively low frequency, ultrasound in sonodynamic therapy using 5-ALA as a sonosensitizer precursor. The utilization of this frequency will contribute to the development of sonodynamic therapy for gliomas and the spread of this technique in many hospitals that possess ultrasonic aspirators.},

abstract = {This paper describes the histogenesis of 3 forms of human malignant melanoma: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, and lentigo maligna melanoma. A comparative analysis by computer of the biologic behavior and clinical characteristics of the different neoplasms has been done. An additional 60 tumors have been studied by serial block section ing. Evidence is presented suggesting that superficial spreading melanoma and lentigo maligna melanoma (Hutchinson's mela notic freckle), though evolving at different rates, show a long period of superficial growth, followed by the relatively rapid appearance of nodules or deeper invasion within the primary lesion. This change in the nature of the primary lesion may be due to the appearance of one or more strains of cells of aggres sive biologic potential. Thus the primary melanoma may exist for a relatively long period of time during which host selec tional forces act to permit the growth of quite malignant strains of cells. It is these cells that seem to be capable of deeper growth. The subdivision of each of the forms of mela noma into 5 anatomic levels of invasion permits the accurate assignment of prognosis to each case. It is suggested that mela nomas are tumors of the epidermal melanocytes and are not necessarily derived from melanocytic nevi. Each melanoma has a distinctive clinical appearance, even in its superficial and curable phases, and this appearance is the same whether or not the process arose in association with a melanocytic nevus.},

Biopsies from three different body sites of 71 human volunteers were obtained, and thickness of the stratum corneum and cellular epidermis was measured microscopically using a preparation technique preventing tissue damage. Multiple regressions analysis was used to evaluate the effect of the various factors independently of each other. Mean (SD) thickness of the stratum corneum was 18.3 (4.9) mmat the dorsal aspect of the forearm, 11.0 (2.2) mm at the shoulder and 14.9 (3.4) mm at the buttock. Corresponding values for the cellular epidermis were 56.6 (11.5) mm, 70.3 (13.6) mm and 81.5 (15.7) mm, respectively. Body site largely explains the variation in epidermal thickness, but also a significant individual variation was observed. Thickness of the stratum corneum correlated positively to pigmentation ( p{\~{}}0.0008) and negatively to the number of years of smoking ( pv0.0001). Thickness of the cellular epidermis correlated positively to blood content (P{\~{}}0.028) and was greater in males than in females (Pv0.0001).

In a 70-kg individual, the skin weighs over 5 kg and covers a surface area approaching 2 m 2 . Human skin consists of a stratifi ed, cellular epidermis and an underlying dermis of connective tissue (Fig. 3.1). Beneath the dermis is a layer of subcutaneous fat, which is separated from the rest of the body by a vestigial layer of striated muscle. The epidermis is mainly composed of keratinocytes and is typi-cally 0.05â€“0.1 mm in thickness. It is formed by division of cells in the basal layer which give rise to the spinous layer. This layer contains cells that move outwards and progressively differentiate, forming the granular layer and the stratum corneum. The cellular progression from the basal layer to the skin surface takes about 30 days but is accelerated in diseases such as psoriasis. The 'brick-like' shape of keratinocytes is provided by a cytoskeleton made of keratin intermediate fi laments. As the epidermis differentiates, the keratinocytes become fl attened. This process involves the fi lament aggregating protein, fi laggrin, a protein component of keratohya-lin granules. Indeed, keratin and fi laggrin comprise 80â€“90{\%} of the mass of the epidermis. The outermost layer of the epidermis is the stratum corneum, where cells (now called corneocytes) have lost nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles. The corneocyte has a highly insoluble, cornifi ed envelope within the plasma membrane, formed by cross-linking of soluble protein precursors, including involucrin and loricrin, the latter contributing 70â€“85{\%} to the mass of the cornifi ed cell envelope; it also contains several lipids (fatty acids, sterols and ceramides) released from lamellar bodies within the upper, living epidermis. Other cells in the epidermis are the melanocytes, Langerhans' cells and Merkel cells. Melanocytes are dendritic cells that distribute packages of melanin pigment in melanosomes to surrounding keratinocytes to give skin its colour. The number of melanocytes does not differ much between white and black skin. Rather it is the nature of the melanin and the size of the melanosomes that account for the different appearances. The Langerhans' cells are also dendritic in nature, although these are of mesenchymal origin and originate from bone marrow. Langerhans' cells are antigen-presenting cells and process anti-gens encountered by the skin to local lymph nodes and thus have a key role in adaptive immune responses in the skin. Merkel cells are probably derived from keratinocytes. They have a role as mechanosensory receptors in response to touch. Human skin contains pilosebaceous follicles and sweat glands. The hair follicles comprise pockets of epithelium that are continu-ous with the superfi cial epidermis but which also envelop a small papilla of dermis at their base. A bundle of smooth muscle, the arrector pili, extends at an angle between the surface of the dermis and a point in the follicle wall. Above the insertion, there are holocrine sebaceous glands which open into the pilary canal. In some sites, such as the axillae, the follicles may be associated with apocrine glands. Also derived from the epidermis and opening directly to the skin surface are the eccrine sweat glands. The epidermis is attached to the dermis via a complex network of proteins and glycoproteins that extend from inside basal},

The incidence, morbidity and mortality rates of skin cancers are increasing and, therefore, pose a significant public health concern. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the major etiologic agent in the development of skin cancers. UVR causes DNA damage and genetic mutations, which subsequently lead to skin cancer. A clearer understanding of UVR is crucial in the prevention of skin cancer. This article reviews UVR, its damaging effects on the skin and its relationship to UV immunosuppression and skin cancer. Several factors influence the amount of UVR reaching the earth's surface, including ozone depletion, UV light elevation, latitude, altitude, and weather conditions. The current treatment modalities utilizing UVR (i.e. phototherapy) can also predispose to skin cancers. Unnecessary exposure to the sun and artificial UVR (tanning lamps) are important personal attributable risks. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of skin cancer with an emphasis on carefully evaluated statistics, the epidemiology of UVR-induced skin cancers, incidence rates, risk factors, and preventative behaviors {\&} strategies, including personal behavioral modifications and public educational initiatives.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite recent improvements in prevention, diagnosis and treatment, vast differences in melanoma burden still exist between populations. Comparative data can highlight these differences and lead to focused efforts to reduce the burden of melanoma. OBJECTIVES To assess global, regional and national melanoma incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015. METHODS Vital registration system and cancer registry data were used for melanoma mortality modelling. Incidence and prevalence were estimated using separately modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios. Total prevalence was divided into four disease phases and multiplied by disability weights to generate years lived with disability (YLDs). Deaths in each age group were multiplied by the reference life expectancy to generate years of life lost (YLLs). YLDs and YLLs were added to estimate DALYs. RESULTS The five world regions with the greatest melanoma incidence, DALY and mortality rates were Australasia, North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Central Europe. With the exception of regions in sub-Saharan Africa, DALY and mortality rates were greater in men than in women. DALY rate by age was highest in those aged 75-79 years, 70-74 years and â‰¥ 80 years. CONCLUSIONS The greatest burden from melanoma falls on Australasian, North American, European, elderly and male populations, which is consistent with previous investigations. These substantial disparities in melanoma burden worldwide highlight the need for aggressive prevention efforts. The Global Burden of Disease Study results can help shape melanoma research and public policy.},

The advent of computers, as well as of lasers and photonics, has made it possible to develop additional techniques that were impossible a few years ago. These approaches provide the dermatologist with sensitive tools to measure the skin's condition in terms of physiologic parameters (e.g., color, erythema and pigmentation, induration, sebaceous and stratum corneum lipids, barrier function, etc.). Yet, a typical dermatologic diagnosis relies primarily on the trained eyes of the physician and to a lesser extent on information from other senses, such as touch and smell. The trained senses of the dermatologist backed by his/her brain form a powerful set of tools for evaluating the skin. The golden rule in diagnosis remains the histologic examination of a skin biopsy, a rather invasive method. These tools have served the profession well. The advent of ever faster and cheaper computers and of sensitive, inexpensive optical instrumentation of minimal dimensions provides the professional with the possibility of making objective measures of a number of skin parameters.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Background: Several dermoscopic and in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) diagnostic criteria of lentigo maligna (LM)/lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) have been identified. However, no study compared the diagnostic accuracy of these techniques. Objective: We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM for LM/LMM using a holistic assessment of the images. Methods: A total of 223 facial lesions were evaluated by 21 experts. Diagnostic accuracy of the clinical, dermoscopic and RCM examination was compared. Interinvestigator variability and confidence level in the diagnosis were also evaluated. Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy of the two imaging techniques was good (area under the curve of the sROC function: 0.89). RCM was more sensitive (80{\%}, vs. 61{\%}) and less specific (81{\%} vs. 92{\%}) than dermoscopy for LM/LMM. In particular, RCM showed a higher sensitivity for hypomelanotic and recurrent LM/LMM. RCM had a higher interinvestigator agreement and a higher confidence level in the diagnosis than dermoscopy. Conclusion: Reflectance confocal microscopy and dermoscopy are both useful techniques for the diagnosis of facial lesions and in particular LM/LMM. RCM is particularly suitable for the identification of hypomelanotic and recurrent LM/LMM.},

abstract = {Dermoscopy is a very useful technique for the analysis of pigmented skin lesions. It represents a link between clinical and histological views, permitting an earlier diagnosis of skin melanoma. It also helps in the diagnosis of many other pigmented skin lesions, such as seborrheic keratosis, pigmented basal cell carcinoma, hemangioma, blue nevus, atypical nevus, and mole, which can often clinically simulate melanoma. In this article, dermoscopy is reviewed from its history to the basic concepts of the interpretation of dermoscopic images. The goal is to introduce this subject to those not yet familiar with it, in order to instigate and encourage the training and practice of this technique of growing importance for everyday usage.},

@article{Tuma2015,
abstract = {Background: The identification of "normal" dermoscopic patterns of acquired melanocytic nevi provides better diagnostic accuracy for melanoma in people with black skin. Objective: We sought to describe melanocytic lesions (numbers and anatomic distributions) in skin types V and VI compared with skin types I and II, according to the Fitzpatrick classification. We sought to identify differences in dermoscopic findings in acquired melanocytic nevi (global pattern, pigment and color distribution) between the groups. Methods: We conducted cross-sectional, prospective, and consecutive data collection in 2 dermatologic outpatient clinics, between October 8, 2010, and March 20, 2013. From the 501 volunteers, 480 participants fulfilled the eligibility criteria. A total of 460 acquired melanocytic nevi were selected for dermoscopic analysis. Results: Individuals with skin type V/VI had fewer melanocytic lesions than those with skin type I/II (15.08 vs 7.90; P = .032), and the anatomic distribution in the first group was predominantly on the face and acral sites (P {\textless} .001). The acquired melanocytic nevi in the skin type V/VI group were associated with the reticular pattern (P {\textless} .0001), with a tendency toward central hyperpigmentation (P = .0025). Limitations: The choice of a single representative nevus per patient is a limitation. Conclusions: Acquired melanocytic nevi in individuals with skin type V/VI have a distinct dermoscopic pattern from those with skin type I/II.},
